#Indian Railway Sleeper Coach Seating arrangement and Seat Finder

Problem statement
On a railroad or ship, a berth is a bed that is typically stacked like bunk beds.

There are five different types of berths available on Indian trains: Lower, Middle, Upper, Side Lower, and Side Upper.

Your objective is to develop a mobile application that, given a seat number, would show the position of the seat and indicate the type of berth it is.

Here is an example of how the app might appear and work, but we encourage that you add your own flair and build something from your own perspective.
